### 1:
Write a function called fetchAlbums that uses the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to fetch a list of albums and returns a promise that resolves to an array of album objects. Use the fetch method to make the API call and the json method to parse the response. Use the filter method to filter out the albums that do not have a title. Use the map method to transform the remaining albums into a simpler format. Write code to test this function by calling it and logging the result.

### 2:
Define a function named fetchPosts that uses the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to fetch a list of posts and returns a promise that resolves to an array of post objects. Use the axios library to make the API call and the data property to parse the response. Use the filter method to filter out the posts that do not have a title. Use the sort method to sort the remaining posts by their ID in ascending order. Write code to test this function by calling it and logging the result.

### 3:
Write a function called fetchUsers that uses the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to fetch a list of users and returns a promise that resolves to an array of user objects. Use the fetch method to make the API call and the json method to parse the response. Use the filter method to filter out the users that do not have an email address. Use the reduce method to calculate the total number of users that have a phone number listed. Write code to test this function by calling it and logging the result.

### 4:
Define a function named fetchComments that uses the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to fetch a list of comments and returns a promise that resolves to an array of comment objects. Use the axios library to make the API call and the data property to parse the response. Use the filter method to filter out the comments that do not have a name. Use the forEach method to display the remaining comments in a table format on a webpage. Write code to test this function by calling it and displaying the result on a webpage.

### 5:
Write a function called fetchTodos that uses the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) to fetch a list of todos and returns a promise that resolves to an array of todo objects. Use the fetch method to make the API call and the json method to parse the response. Use the filter method to filter out the todos that are already completed. Use the map method to transform the remaining todos into a simpler format. Write code to test this function by calling it and logging the result.
